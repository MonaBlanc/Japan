# Japan Travel Landing Page

The website includes four sections: 
* An introduction to Japan
* A section about famous landmarks
* A section about Japanese food and drink
* A section about Japanese culture. 
The website also includes a navigation bar and slider buttons to switch between sections. It was purely made in vanilla CSS and JS to complete the rules of the challenge.
